    "What does chemistry do for society, according to Demitry Mendeleev?",
    "Chemistry facilitates the obtaining of matter and new possibilities of using nature's forces. It also indicates how to prepare substances and their properties.",
    "Thus,    by its assistance, the obtaining of matter in its various forms    is facilitated; it shows new possibilities of availing ourselves    of the forces of nature, indicates the methods of preparing    many substances, points out their properties, &c. In this sense    chemistry is closely connected with the work of the manufacturer    and the artisan, its sphere is active, and is a means of promoting    general welfare. Besides this honourable vocation, chemistry    has another. With it, as with every other elaborated science,    there are many lofty aspirations, the contemplation of which    serves to inspire its workers and adherents. This contemplation    comprises not only the principal data of the science, but also the    generally-accepted deductions, and also hypotheses which refer    to phenomena as yet but imperfectly known. In this latter sense    scientific contemplation varies much with times and persons, it    bears the stamp of creative power, and embraces the highest forms    of scientific progress. In that pure enjoyment experienced on    approaching to the ideal, in that eagerness to draw aside the    veil from the hidden truth, and even in that discord which exists    between the various workers, we ought to see the surest pledges of    further scientific progress. Science thus advances, discovering    new truths, and at the same time obtaining practical results. The    edifice of science not only requires material, but also a plan,    and necessitates the work of preparing the materials, putting them    together, working out the plans and the symmetrical proportions of    the various parts.",
