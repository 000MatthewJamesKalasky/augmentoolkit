# Super Amazing Infinite Data Notebook
-- ~~Pre-Pre-PRE Alpha~~ --
BETA!

Takes plaintext, generates questions off of the bits with educational or philosophical relevance, and generates conversations between characters where those questions are answered, such that infinite multiturn conversational training data is generated from human-written text (such as Gutenberg book).

Put the plaintext books you want to make data from in the same folder as the processing.ipynb notebook, modify the list `source_texts` in said notebook, rent out an A6000 for < $1/hr (or use some other 70b-capable GPU), and enjoy your new dataset creation.
