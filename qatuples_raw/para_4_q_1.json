    "What are the three main branches of chemistry mentioned?",
    "The three main branches of chemistry mentioned are analytical, organic, and theoretical. These are the foundations for any aspiring chemist to master before they can become \"truly practical men\".",
    "Science will then flourish in them and by them, on a fuller    acquaintance not only with that little which is enclosed within    the narrow limits of my work, but with the further learning which    they must imbibe in order to make themselves masters of our    science and partakers in its further advancement. Those who enlist in the cause of science have no reason to fear    when they remember the urgent need for practical workers in the    spheres of agriculture, arts, and manufacture. By summoning    adherents to the work of theoretical chemistry, I am confident    that I call them to a most useful labour, to the habit of dealing    correctly with nature and its laws, and to the possibility of    becoming truly practical men. In order to become actual chemists,    it is necessary for beginners to be well and closely acquainted    with three important branches of chemistry--analytical, organic,    and theoretical. That part of chemistry which is dealt with in    this treatise is only the groundwork of the edifice.",
