    "According to 'Introduction to Philosophy' by Stuart Fullerton, what was the primary focus of the Pre-Socrat philosophers?",
    "The Pre-Socratic philosophers focused on the external world.",
    "Of course, this can only mean that they had little conception of how much there is to explain, and of what is meant by scientific explanation. It is characteristic of this series of philosophers that their attention was directed very largely upon the external world. It was natural that this should be so. Both in the history of the race and in that of the individual, we find that the attention is seized first by material things, and that it is long before a clear conception of the mind and of its knowledge is arrived at. Observation precedes reflection. When we come to think definitely about the mind, we are all apt to make use of notions which we have derived from our experience of external things. The very words we use to denote mental operations are in many instances taken from this outer realm. We \"direct\" the attention; we speak of \"apprehension,\" of \"conception,\" of \"intuition.\" Our knowledge is \"clear\" or \"obscure\"; an oration is \"brilliant\"; an emotion is \"sweet\" or \"bitter.\" What wonder that, as we read over the fragments that have come down to us from the Pre-Socratic philosophers, we should be struck by the fact that they sometimes leave out altogether and sometimes touch lightly upon a number of those things that we regard to-day as peculiarly within the province of the philosopher. They busied themselves with the world as they saw it, and certain things had hardly as yet come definitely within their horizon. 2.",
