    "What does Mendelev say about the role of plans in creating science?",
    "Plans are needed for science, as they provide direction and execution. The architect and creator are often one individual.",
    "To conceive, understand, and grasp the whole    symmetry of the scientific edifice, including its unfinished    portions, is equivalent to tasting that enjoyment only conveyed by    the highest forms of beauty and truth. Without the material, the    plan alone is but a castle in the air--a mere possibility; whilst    the material without a plan is but useless matter. All depends    on the concordance of the materials with the plan and execution,    and the general harmony thereby attained. In the work of science,    the artisan, architect, and creator are very often one and the    same individual; but sometimes, as in other walks of life, there    is a difference between them; sometimes the plan is preconceived,    sometimes it follows the preparation and accumulation of the    raw material. Free access to the edifice of science is not only    allowed to those who devised the plan, worked out the detailed    drawings, prepared the materials, or piled up the brickwork, but    also to all those who are desirous of making a close acquaintance    with the plan, and wish to avoid dwelling in the vaults or in the    garrets where the useless lumber is stored. Knowing how contented, free, and joyful is life in the realm of    science, one fervently wishes that many would enter its portals. On this account many pages of this treatise are unwittingly    stamped with the earnest desire that the habits of chemical    contemplation which I have endeavoured to instil into the minds    of my readers will incite them to the further study of science.",
