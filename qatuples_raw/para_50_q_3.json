    "What were the three schools of philosophy that arose at the close of the fourth century BC?",
    "The Stoics, Epicureans and Skeptics.",
    "Plato is much more interested in the moral sciences than in the physical, but he, nevertheless, feels called upon to give an account of how the world was made and out of what sort of elements. He evidently does not take his own account very seriously, and recognizes that he is on uncertain ground. But he does not consider the matter beyond his jurisdiction. As for Aristotle, that wonderful man seems to have found it possible to represent worthily every science known to his time, and to have marked out several new fields for his successors to cultivate. His philosophy covers physics, cosmology, zo\u00f6logy, logic, metaphysics, ethics, psychology, politics and economics, rhetoric and poetics. Thus we see that the task of the philosopher was much the same at the period of the highest development of the Greek philosophy that it had been earlier. He was supposed to give an account of the system of things. But the notion of what it means to give an account of the system of things had necessarily undergone some change. The philosopher had to be something more than a natural philosopher. 3. PHILOSOPHY AS A GUIDE TO LIFE.--At the close of the fourth century before Christ there arose the schools of the Stoics, the Epicureans, and the Skeptics. In them we seem to find a somewhat new conception of philosophy--philosophy appears as chiefly a guide to life.",
