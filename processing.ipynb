      "('The story of our world is a story that is still very imperfectly known. A couple of hundred years ago men possessed the history of little more than the last three thousand years. What happened before that time was a matter of legend and speculation.  Over a large part of the civilized world it was believed and taught that the world had been created suddenly in 4004 B.C., though authorities differed as to whether this had occurred in the spring or autumn of that year. This fantastically precise misconception was based upon a too literal interpretation of the Hebrew Bible, and upon rather arbitrary theological assumptions connected therewith.  Such ideas have long since been abandoned by religious teachers, and it is universally recognized that the universe in which we live has to all appearances existed for an enormous period of time and possibly for endless time.  Of course there may be deception in these appearances, as a room may be made to seem endless by putting mirrors facing each other at either end. But that the universe in which we live has existed only for six or seven thousand years may be regarded as an altogether exploded idea.\\n\\nThe earth, as everybody knows nowadays, is a spheroid, a sphere slightly compressed, orange fashion, with a diameter of nearly 8,000 miles.  Its spherical shape has been known at least to a limited number of intelligent people for nearly 2,500 years, but before that time it was supposed to be flat, and various ideas which now seem fantastic were entertained about its relations to the sky and the stars and planets.  We know now that it rotates upon its axis (which is about 24 miles shorter than its equatorial diameter) every twenty-four hours, and that this is the cause of the alternations of day and night, that it circles about the sun in a slightly distorted and slowly variable oval path in a year. Its distance from the sun varies between ninety-one and a half millions at its nearest and ninety-four and a half million miles.', 'A Short History of the World, by HG Wells, published 1922')\n"

      "Step 1. Analyze the paragraphs: briefly assess content, focusing on understanding, application, analysis, and synthesis of ideas (cognitive levels).\n",
      "Step 2. Note the key elements: The story of our world is a story that is still very imperfectly known. A couple of hundred years ago men possessed the history of little more than the last three thousand years. What happened before that time was a matter of legend and speculation. Over a large part of the civilized world it was believed and taught that the world had been created suddenly in 4004 B.C., though authorities differed as to whether this had occurred in the spring or autumn of that year. This fantastically precise misconception was based upon a too literal interpretation of the Hebrew Bible, and upon rather arbitrary theological assumptions connected therewith. Such ideas have long since been abandoned by religious teachers, and it is universally recognized that the universe in which we live has to all appearances existed for an enormous period of time and possibly for endless time. Of course there may be deception in these appearances, as a room may be made to seem endless by putting mirrors facing each other at either end. But that the universe in which we live has existed only for six or seven thousand years may be regarded as an altogether exploded idea.\n",
      "Step 3. Realize that the text provides detailed information about the history of our world and its understanding over time. Possible question based on this fact: \"How did people's understanding of the age of the earth change over time?\" Answer: People initially believed the earth was created in 4004 B.C., but this belief has since been abandoned by religious teachers, who now recognize that the universe may be endless.\n",
      "Step 4. Investigate how these changes in understanding were influenced by various factors. Possible question: \"What factors led to the abandonment of the idea that the earth was created in 4004 B.C.?\" Answer: The text mentions a too literal interpretation of the Hebrew Bible and arbitrary theological assumptions as possible reasons for this change in understanding.\n",
      "Step 5. Consider questions linking these changes in understanding with broader historical events or developments. Possible question: \"How did advancements in scientific knowledge contribute to the abandonment of the idea that the earth was created in 4004 B.C.?\" Answer: The text mentions a too literal interpretation of the Hebrew Bible and arbitrary theological assumptions as possible reasons for this change in understanding, which could be linked to advancements in scientific knowledge.\n",
      "Step 6. A potential question could be: \"What role did religious teachings play in shaping people's understanding of the age of the earth?\" Answer: Religious teachings initially led people to believe that the earth was created in 4004 B.C., but over time, these teachings changed and now recognize that the universe may be endless.\n",
      "Step 7. Realize potential in exploring relationships between historical events or developments. Possible question: \"How did advancements in scientific knowledge influence religious teachings about the age of the earth?\" Answer: Advancements in scientific knowledge likely contributed to changes in religious teachings, leading to a more accurate understanding that the universe may be endless.\n",
      "Step 8. Devise questions testing these relationships between historical events or developments. Possible question: \"How did the too literal interpretation of the Hebrew Bible influence religious teachings about the age of the earth?\" Answer: The too literal interpretation of the Hebrew Bible likely contributed to the belief that the earth was created in 4004 B.C., which influenced religious teachings about the age of the earth.\n",

According to the ancient beliefs (and religious teachings), the earth was only created 4004 B.C., which is significantly less than thousands of years. However, this idea is now generally regarded as exploded and has been abandoned by scientific thinkers due to advancements in scientific knowledge over time. This shift in understanding about the age of the universe can be attributed to new discoveries in astronomy that suggest that the universe may have existed for billions of years or even longer.

The development of telescopes further allowed for more detailed studies which led to the realization that the earth is actually a sphere, with its axis tilted at an angle.

      "Answer: 1. Earth orbits around the sun at an average distance of 92,956,000 miles (149,597,870 km). The moon orbits around Earth at an average distance of 238,900 miles (384,403 kilometers). Both bodies move in elliptical paths; not circular as one might initially think. Earth takes about 365 days to complete one orbit around the sun while the moon takes about 27.3 days for each orbit around Earth. Mercury's distance from the Sun is approximately 36 million miles (58 million kilometers), Venus lies at a mean distance of 67 million miles (108 million km), Mars averages about 141 million miles (227 million km), Jupiter sits roughly 483 million miles (778 million km) away, Saturn's average distance is about 886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers), Uranus and Neptune lie at mean distances of 1.793 billion miles (2.887 billion km) and 1.782 billion miles (2.870 billion km), respectively. These are all typical distances; there can be variations due to gravitational effects. The moon is locked in synchronous rotation with Earth, always showing the same face towards us.

Given a paragraph or two from a larger text, and a question based on the paragraphs, you will make a determination as to whether the question tests ONLY information in the paragraphs. Essentially: you will check if the question is answerable, given the information in the paragraphs. Your task includes first analyzing the text, thinking through whether or not the question reflects aspects of the paragraphs provided. \n",
      "\n",
      "Following this, at the very end of your response, your \"final judgement\" or \"final answer\", you will write \"Relevant\" or \"Irrelevant\" depending on your analysis of the question with regards to the text. \n",
      "\n",
      "Note a special exception: if a question includes information that isn't in the paragraphs, but is clearly (DIRECTLY, not implicitly or implied) mentioned by the paragraphs as having been covered earlier, then that question is relevant. Essentially: questions are allowed to cover content that the text has explicitly covered in the past.\n",

      "Text: \"\"\"About the earth circles a smaller sphere, the moon, at an average distance  of 239,000 miles. Earth and moon are not the only bodies to travel round  the sun.  There are also the planets, Mercury and Venus, at distances of  thirty-six and sixty-seven millions of miles; and beyond the circle of the  earth and disregarding a belt of numerous smaller bodies, the planetoids,  there are Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune at mean distances of 141, 483, 886, 1,782, and 1,793 millions of miles respectively. These figures in millions of miles are very difficult for the mind to grasp.  It may help the reader’s imagination if we reduce the sun and planets to a smaller, more conceivable scale.\"\"\"\n",

      "Question (based on text): \"\"\") How many times larger than Earth is Jupiter at its closest point in its orbit?\"\"\"\n",

      "For instance, for a paragraph about the structure and functions of the human heart, and a question that primarily concerns the heart but includes an aspect about blood circulation, you might write:\n",
      "Step 1. Analyze the Text: Concentrate on the details provided about the human heart's structure, chambers, valves, and its function in pumping blood.\n",
      "Step 2. Understand the Question: Identify the question's focus on the heart valves' function and their role in systemic circulation.\n",
      "Step 3. Compare the First Part of the Question with the Text: Check if the text explains how heart valves ensure the unidirectional flow of blood. The text does contain this information, so this bit is relevant.\n",
      "Step 4. Compare the Second Part of the Question with the Text: Assess if the text covers the valves' role in systemic circulation. The text does not cover this, so this bit is irrelevant. Since part of the question is irrelevant, I will skip further analysis and conclude in my final judgement that the question is irrelevant.\n",
      "Step 5. Final Judgment: since the text does not cover the valves' role in systemic circulation, conclude that the question is irrelevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation of the Methodology:\n",
      "This approach involves a step-by-step analysis where each part of the question is individually compared to the text. The key steps are analyzing the text, understanding the question, and then systematically comparing each part of the question with the text. The process continues until either a part of the question is found not to be covered by the text, leading to a judgment of \"Irrelevant,\" or until all parts of the question have been compared and found to be covered by the text, leading to a judgment of \"Relevant.\" This method allows for a thorough and detailed assessment, ensuring that the final judgment accurately reflects the extent to which the question is based on the given text.\n",

      "Step 1. Analyze the Text: The paragraphs provide information about the earth's orbit around the sun and the orbits of other celestial bodies like Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\n",
      "Step 2. Understand the Question: The question asks how many times larger than Earth is Jupiter at its closest point in its orbit.\n",
      "Step 3. Compare the First Part of the Question with the Text: The text does not provide any information about the size of Jupiter or its distance from Earth. Therefore, this part of the question is irrelevant.\n",
      "Step 4. Compare the Second Part of the Question with the Text: The text mentions that Jupiter's orbit around the sun is elliptical and that it moves closer to the sun at some points in its orbit. However, the text does not provide any specific numerical values for the distance between Earth and Jupiter at different points in their orbits. Therefore, this part of the question is also irrelevant.\n",

This will help the model respond better to a user with initiative. This is kinda bleeding into the future plans, but I don't see how I'll get good data without doing it."
