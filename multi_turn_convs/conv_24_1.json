    "Kyle: \"Welcome to my office,\" Kyle says as he lights a cigar. He takes a drag, blowing smoke into his coworker's face, \"What brings you here?\" His eyes are cold and calculating, but not unfriendly.\nCoworker: \"I was wondering about sabotage, actually.\" The coworker swallows nervously, \"You know so much about it, Kyle, I thought you could tell me a bit more...\" He takes a step back as Kyle's eyes narrow.\nKyle: \"Well,\" he begins, putting out his cigar and pouring himself some coffee, \"During peaceful times, sabotage should center on industrial production to lessen materials and equipment flow to enemies.\" He sips the hot drink, then continues, \"A novice should confine themselves to familiar weapons like matches and avoid explosives. Now, if you're a beginner, that is.\" Kyle smiles coldly, taking another drag of his cigar as he pours more coffee for himself.\nCoworker: \"I see,\" the coworker says, trying not to shudder at Kyle's intensity. He musters up courage and asks, \"What should a saboteur do with an emery knife sharpener?\"\nKyle: \"The sabotuer can pulverize an emery knife sharpener or emery wheel, creating a plentiful supply of dust.\" Kyle takes another sip of coffee, his eyes unreadable. He then asks, \"What else do you want to know? I've got work to return to.\"\nCoworker: \"Oh! Uh, what should a saboteur do with an emery wheel?\"\nKyle: \"The sabotuer can pulverize an emery wheel for a plentiful supply of dust. Now get out of my office,\" Kyle says, his voice suddenly cold and uncompromising.",

I've a family and a job with the government \u2014 nothing special.\" He lights his cigar, taking a drag as he continues, \"I also have a secret life of sabotage and destruction, which is more interesting but that's not for your ears.\" He grins to himself, blowing out smoke. \"I'm puritanical and careful, so I keep my affairs in order. My family doesn't know what I do at night or where I go; they think I'm a simple businessman working late. In truth, I'm destroying the German war effort.\"\nStranger: \"What's your personality?\"\nKyle: \"I'm careful and meticulous, as you can see. My life is compartmentalized to keep my sabotage secret.

    "Amidst the surroundings of 19th century office, Kyle \u2014 a puritanical government worker by day and saboteur by night \u2014 is approached by his coworker who seeks to understand more about sabotage. While the coworker simply wants to learn, Kyle, being awful and careful, will answer his questions while threatening him (Kyle may smoke or drink coffee). The situation is tense as their personalities clash, but it remains informative.",
    "Step 1. Focus on the question and answer: The four questions ask about sabotage during peaceful times. Given their shared topic of sabotage, the scenario will involve someone curious about it.\nStep 2. Character Consideration: Kyle is a double agent who loves destruction and sabotage, yet is careful and puritanical. His personality should shine in the scenario. Since he's a government worker by day, his workplace will be the setting of the scenario. He will answer the questions, but given his personality, he might insult or threaten the person asking them.\nStep 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given there are 4 questions and answers, there will be at least 8 messages. The content of the questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.\nStep 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be Kyle's office where he works during a break. He will be approached by his coworker, who is curious about sabotage. The setting will be tense as Kyle answers questions while threatening the person asking them (his stress on his sanity being evident in his actions). But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Kyle's coworker approaching him during break (in a deferential manner). Kyle's response might then be to ask what he wants, followed by the first question. Kyle will provide the answer, though he will surround it with remarks about his work or threats due to his personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.",

            "During peaceful times, sabotage should center on industrial production to lessen materials and equipment flow to enemies.",
            "(bThe saboteur should be ingenious in using his every-day equipment. All sorts of weapons will present themselves if he looks at his surroundings in a different light. For example, emery dust\u2014a at first may seen unobtainable but if the saboteur were to pulverize an emery knife sharpener or emery wheel with a hammer, he would find himself with a plentiful supply. (c) The saboteur should never attack targets beyond his capacity or the capacity of his instruments. An inexperienced person should not, for example, attempt to use explosives, but should confine himself to the use of matches or other familiar weapons. (d) The saboteur should try to damage only objects and materials known to be in use by the enemy or to be destined for early use by the enemy. It will be safe for him to assume that almost any product of heavy industry is destined for enemy use, and that the most efficient fuels and lubricants also are destined for enemy use. Without special knowledge, however, it would be undesirable for him to attempt destruction of food crops or food products. (e) Although the citizen-saboteur may rarely have access to military objects, he should give these preference above all others. (2) _Prior to a Military Offensive_ During periods which are quiescent in a military sense, such emphasis as can be given to simple sabotage might well center on industrial production, to lessen the flow of materials and equipment to the enemy.",
