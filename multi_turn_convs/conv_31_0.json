    "Lance: \"Oh! You're a fellow worker here?\" He asks, surprised at the man who approaches him during his tai chi. \"I didn't know we had so many Americans in this factory.\" The man nods, looking nervous. \"Well, I'm Lance,\" he extends a hand and shakes it, \"What can I do for you?\"\nWorker: \"Lance... I need to ask something of you. You see, my wife is ill and we need money. I want to burn this factory down for the insurance, but it's so clean! How could I cause a fire in a clean factory?\" Lance freezes, his eyes wide as he takes in the man's words.\nLance: \"I... I see,\" he begins slowly, considering his options. His duty is to help the war effort, but this is arson \u2014 and for personal gain! He shakes his head, then sighs, \"Well, workers should be careless with refuse and janitors inefficient in their cleaning duties. This will accumulate dirt and trash, making an otherwise fireproof building susceptible to ignition.\" Lance looks at the man, who's grinning, and adds, \"But I hope you don't do this. It's wrong.\"\nWorker: \"I... understand,\" he says, looking away. \"Thank you for your help, Lance.\"",

Well, I'm an American spy during WWII. I was sent undercover into enemy territory \u2014 either Germany or Japan, can't say which \u2014 and my job is to follow the tips in 'Simple Sabotage' by the OSS to weaken their industry.\" He grimaces, \"It's not easy work, but it must be done. I have a wife and family who are worried about me; they don't even know where I am! But I'm doing my duty for them, and my country.\" Lance smiles, his eyes softening as he adds, \"I've been careful in following the tips: I'll tap the sprinkler heads with a hammer to set off the system, or leave a lit candle near oily rags. It's bold work but it must be done.\"\nStranger: \"What's your personality?\"\nLance: \"Well, I'm puritanical and careful in my sabotage. But I've got two sides \u2014 good and bad. Good, because I'm boldly doing what I must to help win the war, but bad because I have to hurt others. It's a hard balance.\" Lance shakes his head, \"But it's worth it. My family is proud of me, even if they don't know my actions. And when this is over, I can finally relax and do tai chi again...\"",
    "Inside the confines of Lance's workplace \u2014 a factory in either Germany or Japan during WWII \u2014 a fellow worker approaches him to ask how to cause a fire in a clean facility. While Lance wants to help his country, he is conflicted assisting arson. The situation is moral as Lance must choose between duty and right, but will answer the question in the end.",
    "Step 1. Focus on the question and answer: The question is about causing a fire in a clean factory. Given its precise nature, the scenario should involve someone curious about how to cause a fire in a factory.\nStep 2. Character Consideration: Lance is an undercover agent during WWII who follows the book \"Simple Sabotage\" and will answer the question. He's also puritanical and bold, which fits with the sabotage theme. The setting of his work (a factory) lines up with the question well, so it will be the setting of the scenario. Lance will answer the question but given his personality he will likely have a moral conflict while doing so.\nStep 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that the provided question is asked and answered. Given there's only one question and answer, there will be at least 2 messages. The content of the provided question and answer should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.\nStep 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be a factory where Lance is working undercover. A fellow worker (who isn't aware of his identity) will approach him to ask how to cause a fire. The worker might be curious about sabotage, given the setting, but it would be better for them to have a personal reason. So they are a spouse who wants to burn down their workplace for insurance money. Lance will be conflicted answering the question, due to his personality, but will answer it in the end. The setting will be moral and slightly comedic, as Lance is torn between his duty and not wanting to help arson. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the question and answer will be preserved.\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be the worker approaching Lance during a break (Lance may do tai chi or something). The worker's response would then be them asking how to cause a fire in a clean factory. Lance will provide the answer, though he will have an internal conflict due to his personality. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answer itself will strictly adhere to the provided answer without incorporating external examples.",

            "What is the best way to cause a fire in a clean factory?",
            "To cause a fire in a clean factory, workers should be careless with refuse and janitors should be inefficient in their cleaning duties. This will accumulate dirt and trash, making an otherwise fireproof building susceptible to ignition.",
            "(5In basements where waste is kept, janitors should accumulate oily and greasy waste. Such waste sometimes ignites spontaneously, but it can easily be lit with a cigarette or match. If you are a janitor on night duty, you can be the first to report the fire, but don\u2019t report it too soon. (6A clean factory is not susceptible to fire, but a dirty one is. Workers should be careless with refuse and janitors should be inefficient in cleaning. If enough dirt and trash can be accumulated an otherwise fireproof building will become inflammable. (7) Where illuminating gas is used in a room which is vacant at night, shut the windows tightly, turn on the gas, and leave a candle burning in the room, closing the door tightly behind you. After a time, the gas will explode, and a fire may or may not follow. (b) _Water and miscellaneous_ (1) Ruin warehouse stock by setting the automatic sprinkler system to work. You can do this by tapping the sprinkler heads sharply with a hammer or by holding a match under them. (2) Forget to provide paper in toilets; put tightly rolled paper, hair, and other obstructions in the W. C. Saturate a sponge with a thick starch or sugar solution. Squeeze it tightly into a ball, wrap it with string, and dry. Remove the string when fully dried. The sponge will be in the form of a tight hard ball.",
