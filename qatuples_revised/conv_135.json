    "What is the main purpose of 'Introduction to Philosophy' by George Stuart Fullerton?",
    "The book's primary aim is to explain what philosophy entails and its value, as well as the nature of philosophical thinking. It also delves into the problems philosophers have tackled and the various doctrines that have arisen from these issues. Lastly, it aims to show how philosophy relates to other sciences.",
    "To point out what the word \"philosophy\" is made to cover in our universities and colleges at the present day, and to show why it is given this meaning. 2. To explain the nature of reflective or philosophical thinking, and to show how it differs from common thought and from science. 3. To give a general view of the main problems with which philosophers have felt called upon to deal. 4. To give an account of some of the more important types of philosophical doctrine which have arisen out of the consideration of such problems. 5. To indicate the relation of philosophy to the so-called philosophical sciences, and to the other sciences. 6. To show, finally, that the study of philosophy is of value to us all, and to give some practical admonitions on spirit and method. Had these admonitions been impressed upon me at a time when I was in especial need of guidance, I feel that they would have spared me no little anxiety and confusion of mind. For this reason, I recommend them to the attention of the reader. Such is the scope of my book. It aims to tell what philosophy is. It is not its chief object to advocate a particular type of doctrine. At the same time, as it is impossible to treat of the problems of philosophy except from some point of view, it will be found that, in Chapters III to XI, a doctrine is presented. It is the same as that presented much more in detail, and with a greater wealth of reference, in my \"System of Metaphysics,\" which was published a short time ago.",
