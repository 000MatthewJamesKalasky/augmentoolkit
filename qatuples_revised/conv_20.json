    "How does practical work relate to theoretical understanding in chemistry, according to Demitry Mendeleev?",
    "In the text 'Principles of Chemistry', Demitry Mendelev believes that practical work sharpens the faculty of judgement and criticism while studying special chemical questions.",
    "For the    learning and development of chemistry in its truest and fullest    sense, beginners ought, in the first place, to turn their    attention to the practical work of analytical chemistry; in the    second place, to practical and theoretical acquaintance with some    special chemical question, studying the original treatises of the    investigators of the subject (at first, under the direction of    experienced teachers), because in working out particular facts the    faculty of judgment and of correct criticism becomes sharpened; in    the third place, to a knowledge of current scientific questions    through the special chemical journals and papers, and by    intercourse with other chemists. The time has come to turn aside    from visionary contemplation, from platonic aspirations, and from    classical verbosity, and to enter the regions of actual labour for    the common weal, to prove that the study of science is not only    air excellent education for youth, but that it instils the virtues    of industry and veracity, and creates solid national wealth,    material and mental, which without it would be unattainable. Science, which deals with the infinite, is itself without bounds. Thus the desire to direct those thirsting for truth to the pure source of the science of the forces acting throughout nature forms the first and most important aim of this book. The time has arrived when a knowledge of physics and chemistry forms as important a part of education as that of the classics did two centuries ago. In those days the nations which excelled in classical learning stood foremost, just as now the most advanced are those which are superior in the knowledge of the natural sciences, for they form the strength and characteristic of our times.",
