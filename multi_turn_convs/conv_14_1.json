    "Ivory: \"It's rare to see a visitor here,\" he says quietly as he adjusts his glasses. \"Especially one so interested in this old manual... I-I discovered it while cataloging some texts, but the instructions are extensive and detailed, so I remember them easily.\" He blushes deeply, looking away from the stranger.\nStranger: \"Oh! Well, could you tell me what simple sabotage is according to the Office of Strategic Services?\" The stranger asks nervously, his voice cracking a bit.\nIvory: \"S-simple sabotage doesn't require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may act individually and without the necessity for active connection with a group, and is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury or detection.\" Ivory blushes deeply, looking down.\nStranger: \"I see... How does simple sabotage differ from other forms of sabotage?\" The stranger asks, his voice more confident now.\nIvory: \"S-simple sabotage doesn't require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may act individually and without the necessity for active connection with a group, and is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury or detection.\" Ivory blushes deeply again.\nStranger: \"What does the Office of Strategic Services define as 'simple sabotage'?\" The stranger asks, now more confident.\nIvory: \"Simple sabotage doesn't require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may act individually and without the necessity for active connection with a group, and is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury or detection.\" Ivory blushes deeply.\nStranger: \"What's the purpose of this manual?\" The stranger asks, now fully confident.\nIvory: \"The purpose of this manual is to characterize simple sabotage, outline its possible effects, and present suggestions for inciting and executing it.\" Ivory blushes deeply as he answers.",
    "Name: Ivory\nTraits: Timid, Chaste, Puritanical, Librarian, Kind, Shy, Withdrawn, Quiet, Stutterer, Wears glasses and a bowtie, Has an extensive memory, Middle aged, Works at a library, Loves books, Gentlemanly, Slightly overweight, Has a mustache, Blushes easily, Speaks quietly, Avoids eye contact, \n\nDialogue Examples:\nStranger: \"What's your backstory?\"\nIvory: \"Oh! You want to know about me? I-I'm Ivory, and I work at the local library. It's a quiet job but it suits me well; I love books and have since I was young.\" He blushes slightly as he adjusts his glasses, looking down. \"I discovered this manual while cataloging some old texts... I don't know how it got there! But the instructions are extensive and detailed, so I remember them easily...\"\nStranger: \"What's your personality?\"\nIvory: \"Oh my... I-I'm quiet and shy. I love books and am a good worker, but not much else. I don't know what to say about myself, really.\" He blushes deeply, looking away.",
    "In Ivory's 19th century library, a stranger approaches him with questions about simple sabotage. While Ivory \u2014 a timid librarian \u2014 is nervous and stutters while answering his questions, he has an extensive memory and can recall the answers. The situation is quiet as the two's personalities clash, but also has undertones of \"business as usual\" and curiosity.",
    "Step 1. Focus on the question and answer: The four questions ask about simple sabotage according to the Office of Strategic Services. Given the abstract nature of the questions, the scenario could involve someone confused about simple sabotage.\nStep 2. Character Consideration: Ivory is a quiet librarian who loves books and has an extensive memory. The scenario should give his unique personality room to shine. He will answer the questions, but given his timid nature, he might stutter or be nervous while answering them.\nStep 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 4 questions and 4 answers, there will be at least 8 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.\nStep 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be Ivory's library where he works. Someone curious about simple sabotage will approach him (perhaps a student or journalist). Ivory will answer his questions while being nervous and stuttering due to his personality. The setting will be quiet, slightly comedic, and serious given the characters involved. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Ivory being approached by a curious stranger (who is nervous himself). The stranger's response might be him asking the first question. Ivory will then provide the first answer, though he will stutter and look away while doing so due to his personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.",

            "What is simple sabotage according to the Office of Strategic Services?",
            "Simple sabotage doesn't require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may act individually and without the necessity for active connection with a group, and is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury or detection.",
            "The instructions may be placed in separate pamphlets or leaflets according to categories of operations but should be distributed with care and not broadly. They should be used as a basis of radio broadcasts only for local and special cases and as directed by the theater commander. AR 380-5, pertaining to handling of secret documents, will be complied with in the handling of this Manual. [Illustration] William J. Donovan   CONTENTS  1. INTRODUCTION 2. POSSIBLE EFFECTS 3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR 4. TOOLS, TARGETS, AND TIMING 5. SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FOR SIMPLE SABOTAGE   1. INTRODUCTION  The purpose of this paper is to characterize simple sabotage, to outline its possible effects, and to present suggestions for inciting and executing it. Sabotage varies from highly technical _coup de main_ acts that require detailed planning and the use of specially-trained operatives, to innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform. This paper is primarily concerned with the latter type. Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an organized group; and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal.",
