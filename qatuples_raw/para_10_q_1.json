    "What is the author's main goal in this passage?",
    "The author aims to convince readers that solutions are instances of definite compounds, subject to Dalton's laws, and hopes his ideas will be recognized by those who can experimentally verify them. He also wishes to make chemistry more accessible through dividing the text into footnotes for details.",
    "If in solutions I see and can frequently prove distinct evidences of the existence of those definite compounds which form the more generalised province of chemical data, I could not refrain from going into certain details respecting solutions; otherwise, there would have remained no trace of that general idea, that in them we have only a certain instance of ordinary definite or atomic compounds, subject to Dalton's laws. Having long had this idea, I wished to impress it upon the reader of my book, and it is this desire which forms the second of those chief reasons why I recur so frequently to solutions in this work. At present, my ideas respecting solutions are shared by few, but I trust that by degrees the instances I give will pave the way for their general recognition, and it is my hope that they may find adherents among those of my readers who are in a position to work out by experiment this difficult but highly interesting problem. [7] The fifth edition was not only considerably enlarged, compared with    the preceding, but also the foundations of the periodic system    of the elements were placed far more firmly in it than in the    former editions. The subject-matter was also divided into    text and footnotes, which contained details unnecessary for a    first acquaintance with chemistry. The fifth edition sold out    sooner than I expected, so that instead of issuing supplements    (containing the latest discoveries in chemistry), as I had    proposed, I was obliged to publish the present entirely new    edition of the work.",
