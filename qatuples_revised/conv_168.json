    "What does 'philosophy' mean?",
    "Philosophy means love of wisdom.",
    "He makes Croesus tell Solon how he has heard that he \"from a desire of knowledge has, philosophizing, journeyed through many lands.\" The word \"philosophizing\" seems to indicate that Solon pursued knowledge for its own sake, and was what we call an investigator. As for the word \"philosopher\" (etymologically, a lover of wisdom), a certain somewhat unreliable tradition traces it back to Pythagoras (about 582-500 B.C.). As told by Cicero, the story is that, in a conversation with Leon, the ruler of Phlius, in the Peloponnesus, he described himself as a philosopher, and said that his business was an investigation into the nature of things. At any rate, both the words \"philosopher\" and \"philosophy\" are freely used in the writings of the disciples of Socrates (470-399 B.C. ), and it is possible that he was the first to make use of them. The seeming modesty of the title philosopher--for etymologically it is a modest one, though it has managed to gather a very different signification with the lapse of time--the modesty of the title would naturally appeal to a man who claimed so much ignorance, as Socrates; and Plato represents him as distinguishing between the lover of wisdom and the wise, on the ground that God alone may be called wise. From that date to this the word \"philosopher\" has remained with us, and it has meant many things to many men.",
