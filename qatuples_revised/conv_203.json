    "What is a philosopher's task, according to 'Introduction to Philosophy'?",
    "The philosopher's task, according to this text, is to give an account of the origin and development of things.",
    "The philosopher still regarded the universe of knowledge as his province. 4. PHILOSOPHY IN THE MIDDLE AGES.--I cannot do more than mention Neo-Platonism, that half Greek and half Oriental system of doctrine which arose in the third century after Christ, the first system of importance after the schools mentioned above. But I must not pass it by without pointing out that the Neo-Platonic philosopher undertook to give an account of the origin, development, and end of the whole system of things. In the Middle Ages there gradually grew up rather a sharp distinction between those things that can be known through the unaided reason and those things that can only be known through a supernatural revelation. The term \"philosophy\" came to be synonymous with knowledge attained by the natural light of reason. This seems to imply some sort of a limitation to the task of the philosopher. Philosophy is not synonymous with all knowledge. But we must not forget to take note of the fact that philosophy, even with this limitation, constitutes a pretty wide field. It covers both the physical and the moral sciences. Nor should we omit to notice that the scholastic philosopher was at the same time a theologian. Albert the Great and St. Thomas Aquinas, the famous scholastics of the thirteenth century, had to write a \"_Summa Theologiae_,\" or system of theology, as well as to treat of the other departments of human knowledge. Why were these men not overwhelmed with the task set them by the tradition of their time?",
