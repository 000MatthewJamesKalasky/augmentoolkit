    "How will chemistry's future development affect our understanding of nature, according to Demitry Mendeleev in 'Principles of Chemistry'?",
    "Chemistry, as a young science, strives to introduce new life into natural philosophy and discover the life of atoms and molecules. It will enlarge the scope of vision and discover the life of atoms and molecules.",
    "In studying the general uniformity from a mechanical point of    view, I think that the highest point of knowledge of nature    cannot be attained without taking into account the individuality    of things in which chemistry is set to seek for general higher    laws. Mechanics may be likened to the science of statesmanship,    chemistry to the sciences of jurisprudence and sociology. The    general universe could not be built up without the particular    individual universe, and would be a dry abstract were it not    enlivened by the real variety of the individual world. Mechanics    forms the classical basis of natural philosophy, while chemistry,    as a comparatively new and still young science, already strives    to--and will, in the future introduce a new, living aspect into    the philosophy of nature; all the more as chemistry alone is never    at rest or anywhere dead--its vital action has universal sway, and    inevitably determines the general aspect of the universe. Just    as the microscope and telescope enlarge the scope of vision, and    discover life in seeming immobility, so chemistry, in discovering    and striving to discern the life of the invisible world of atoms    and molecules and their ultimate limit of divisibility, will    clearly introduce new and important problems into our conception    of nature. And I think that its _r\u00f4le_, which is now considerable,    will increase more and more in the future; that is, I think that    in its further development it will occupy a place side by side    with mechanics for the comprehension of the secrets of nature.",
